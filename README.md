# WTF Does That Stand For? (WinUI)
This is a win-x64 version of WTFdtsf. A game where your job is to come up with an explanation of what a randomly generated acronym could mean. The crazier, the better.
>[!NOTE]
>As of now, this version does not have all the same features the text-based WTFdtsf does.
