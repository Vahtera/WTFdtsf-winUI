# WTF Does That Stand For? (WinUI)
This is a win-x64 version of WTFdtsf. A game where your job is to come up with an explanation of what a randomly generated acronym could mean. The crazier, the better.
>[!NOTE]
>Unlike the text-based version, this one cannot (yet) be translated, nor does it have the ability to use custom word lists.
>You also don't need to specify the number of players, as it's dynamic.
