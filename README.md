# WTF Does That Stand For? (WinUI)
This is a win-x64 version of WTFdtsf. A game where your job is to come up with an explanation of what a randomly generated acronym could mean. The crazier, the better.

Features:
* Unlimited players
* Custom wordlists (one word per line, plain text)
* Acronym length from two to seven.
* Randomize order of results after turn ends.

Rules:

* WTFdtsf will give you 2 to 7 letters, with the chance of one of the letters replaced with a word.
Your task is to form an explanation of what this 'acronym' stands for.

* Inflections of the given words are permitted.
(eg. If the word given is 'Run', you can use 'Running'.)

* Prepositions, articles, and punctuation do not count as words,
so you can use them as much or as little as you want.

>[!NOTE]
>Unlike the text-based version, this one cannot (yet) be translated.
>You also don't need to specify the number of players, as it's dynamic.
